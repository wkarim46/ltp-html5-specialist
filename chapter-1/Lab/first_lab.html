	<h2>“Places I’d like to Visit</h2>
	<p>I've traveled to many corners of the world. But There are always new adventures, new people, new cultures to experience. Below is a list of a few places I'd love to visit. With any luck I'll make it happen within the next couple years, or at least while I'm still "on the right side of the dirt".</p>
	<ul>
		<li><a href = "https://www.lonelyplanet.com/australia"> Australia</a>, is in my opinion, one of the most beautiful continents. </li>
			<li><a href = "https://www.nps.gov/viis/planyourvisit/index.htm">Virgin Islands National Park</a> is certainly a sight to see.</li>
			<li><a href="https://www.visitnorway.com/places-to-go/northern-norway/the-lofoten-islands/">The Norwegian Islands</a> I find simply mystical...and cold. But I can't wait to visit them next summer.</li>
